# Wireframe 

### A powerful 0 cost no GUI game engine that provides control and speed to the programmer, while also providing ease of use.

Compile this with CMake. (This comes with a demo of how to use this in Example, for which you'll have to drag the files from the Audio subdirectory next to the generated executable, and drag the files from the Shaders subdirectory next to the generated executable.

You can find extensions (basically just small pieces of code that you can include in your project to make developing stuff easier) in the extensions subdirectory! Just plop them into a folder that you can include stuff from and include them!
Here are the currently available extensions(, and just like with the rest of the project I will be happy to except more extesions or changes to extesions):<br/>

This project relies on: <br/>
EzAL: https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/EzAL <br/>
EzGL: https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/EzGL

To see the dependencies just click the links!

Just like the EzAL, and EzGL, I'd be glad to accept additions to Wireframe to improve the library since I want to support more libraries, APIs, platforms, and more, and generally improve this project.
